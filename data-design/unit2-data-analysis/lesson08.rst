Lesson 8: Objects pt. 2
=======================

Goals
-----

- Understand the role of object-oriented inheritance to enable effective code resuse.
- Effectively use Python's inheritance tools to build clean, reusable code.

Objectives
----------

- Use the ``()`` syntax to allow one class to inherit from another
- Explain which fields and methods are inherited by a class extension, based on Java's rules and taking into account access modifiers
- Call a parent class constructor from a child class constructor
- Override methods from parent class in child class
- Explain how variable and parameter declaration relates to inheritance (i.e. how inheritance enables polymorphic behavior)
- Use basic class diagrams to visualize and design class relationships
