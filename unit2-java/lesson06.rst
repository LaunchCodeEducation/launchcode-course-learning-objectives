Unit 2 (Java) - Lesson 6 Learning Objectives
============================================

Goals
-----

- Understand the role of object-oriented inheritance to enable effective code resuse.
- Effectively use Java's inheritance tools to build clean, reusable code.

Objectives
----------

- Use the ``extends`` keyword to allow one class to inherit from another
- Explain which fields and methods are inherited by a class extension, based on Java's rules and taking into account access modifiers
- Call a parent class constructor from a child class constructor
- Override methods when extending a class
- Describe the role of the ``Object`` class in each class' hierarchy
- Describe and use abstract classes and abstract methods
- Explain how variable and parameter declaration relates to inheritance (i.e.Â how inheritance enables polymorphic behavior)
- Use basic class diagrams to visualize and design class relationships
- Write unit tests to verify Java code that uses inheritance
