Unit 1 - Lesson 7 Learning Objectives
=====================================

Goals
-----

- Create and use object literals in JS
- Use the ``Math`` module for common mathematical operations

Objectives
----------

Objects
^^^^^^^

- Understand objects a collections of properties that are key/value
   pairs
- Create objects
- Describe the allowed data types of keys and values
- Understand a method of an object as a property which has a value that
   is a function
- Use the ``this`` keyword within a method to reference the object that
   the method belongs to
- Utilize objects as input parameters and return values of functions
- Access and modify object properties using both bracket syntax and
   dot-notation
- Use a ``for...in`` loop to iterate through the properties of an
   object
- Use the ``delete`` operator to remove properties from an object
- Understand object values as references, and how that affects
   comparisons between objects

The ``Math`` Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use ``Math.PI`` to obtain the value of the mathemtical constant Pi
- Understand and properly use common ``Math`` functions: ``random``,
   ``round``, ``floor``, ``ceil``, ``sqrt``, ``trunc``, ``abs``
