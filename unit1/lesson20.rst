At the end of class 3 students will be able to create a Angular application that can pull data from an external API using fetch.

Class 3

* Attribute directives alter the behavior of HTML elements.
* Many attribute directives can be applied to one host element.
* Alter element style using style binding `<button [style.color]="isSpecial ? 'red': 'green'">`
* Use property binding such as `[class.warning]="isWarning"` to change css class property of an element.
* Use property binding to disable inputs `<input [disabled]="disabled"/>`
* In a component use `fetch` to make a request to an API and show that data in a component
