Unit 1 - Lesson 4 Learning Objectives
=====================================

Goals
-----

- Create and work with arrays using bracket notation and common array methods
- Understand strings as ordered collections, similar to arrays
- Work with strings using bracket notation and commont string methods

Objectives
----------

Arrays
^^^^^^

- Create an array literal
- Create an array of size ``n`` with ``Array(n)``
- Create arrays that store multiple types of values
- Create arrays that store other arrays (i.e. multi-dimensional arrays)
- Access elements within multi-dimensional arrays
- Find the length of an array using the ``.length`` method
- Index into an array using bracket notation
- Set an element of an array using bracket notation assignment
- Understand what happens when asking for an element at index at which no element exists
- Use common array methods: ``concat``, ``join``, ``split``, ``push``, ``pop``, ``shift``, ``unshift``, ``slice``, ``reverse``, ``sort``, ``indexOf``

Strings
^^^^^^^

- Understand strings, like arrays, are indexed collections
- Index into a string using bracket notation
- Understand that characters of a string may not be set using bracket notation assignment
- Find the length of a string using the ``.length`` method
- Create strings with special characters: ``\n``, ``\t``, unicode (e.g. ``'\u03a9'``)
- Include quotes with strings by escaping them
- Use template literals to create strings that rely on variable values
- Use common string methods: ``indexOf``, ``charAt``, ``toLowerCase``, ``toUpperCase``, ``trim``, ``replace``, ``substring``, ``slice``
- Understand how ASCII allows characters to be represented as numbers
- Convert characters from string to ASCII codes and back using ``charCodeAt`` and ``String.fromCharCode``
