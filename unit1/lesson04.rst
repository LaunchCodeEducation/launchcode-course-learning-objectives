Unit 1 - Lesson 4 Learning Objectives
=====================================

Goals
-----

- Use iteration to repeat the execution of a code block
- Properly write ``for`` and ``while`` loops
- Use ``for`` and ``while`` loops in appropriate contexts

Objectives
----------

Loops
^^^^^

- Write ``for`` loop that iterates from 0â€¦n
- Describe the role of each of the 3 components of a ``for`` statement:
   initialization, condition, final expression
- Iterate over strings
- Iterate over arrays
- Write ``for`` loops that initialize a variable to something other
   than 0
- Write ``for`` loops that have a condition other than ``i < n``
- Write ``for`` loops that have a final expression other than ``i++``
- Write a ``while`` loop with a simple comparison condition
- Write a ``while`` loop that validates user input
- Describe the behavior of an infinite loop and how one can be avoided
- Understand the differences between ``for`` and ``while`` loops, and
   when each is preferred
- Use a ``break`` statement to terminate a loop
- Use the accumulator pattern
