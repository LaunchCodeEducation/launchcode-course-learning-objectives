# Unit 1 - Lesson 8 Learning Objectives

## Goals

- Write unit tests to test the behavior of functions
- Identify proper test cases for which a test should be written
- Understand the importance of testing in creating well-functioning code
- Use test-driven development to define the behavior of code before writing it, and to ensure that code is properly tested

## Objectives

### Unit Testing

- Describe the importance of unit testing
- Explain what a unit test is
- Describe how the concept of assertions allows us to define expected behavior of code
- Identify test cases, including test case types: positive, negative, edge
- Set up a test suite with Jasmine and the `assert` module
- Write Jasmine tests using `assert.equal`, `assert.notEqual`, and `assert.throws`

### Test-driven Development

- Explain how test-driven development helps reduce bugs in code
- Use the red-green-refactor technique to implement TDD
