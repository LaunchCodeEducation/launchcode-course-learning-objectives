High level Angular goals, these will need to broken up over 3 classes.

Misc Notes/Decisions

* avoid Observable if possible and use fetch instead 
* make sure the three angular days progress well, we don't drown them in a bad way

At the end of class 1 students will be able to create a simple Hello World Angular component that includes HTML/CSS/JavaScript as one component.

Class 1

* why are js libraries popular
* create an angular app with angular cli
* understand the concept of components
* Angular folder/file setup

Class 2

* click handlers
* data binding
* using local static data

Class 3

* something about async data
* what changes in template for async data?
* consume data from external API using fetch

  * could host it on same droplet as this https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/request-parrot
