# Unit 1 - Lesson 10 Learning Objectives

## Goals

- Understand how the manner and location of variable declaration affects how it can be used.
- Define variables with the minimal scope necessary.
- Understand how JS handles types, and how a type system is a fundamental aspect of a programming language.
- Understand the meaning and use-cases of special values in JS.
- Effectively throw and catch exceptions to improve user experience and make debugging easier

## Objectives

### Scope

- Understand the contexts in which a variable may be declared: block/local, global, execution context
- Understand and properly declare variables in the best context for the intended use
- Describe shadowing, and how it affects variable visibility
- Explain variable hoisting

### More on Types

- Describe the meaning of special primitive types `undefined` and `null` and provide examples of situations in which they may be used
- Understand the difference between primitive and object types, including what it means for primitive types to be immutable
- List the 6 primitive types in JS: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined`

### Exceptions

- Explain what an exception is and why exceptions are used
- Write a program using a try/catch block
- Catch exceptions only when something meaningful can be done
- Throw exceptions with clear, descriptive messages
- Throw exceptions only when the program can not be properly executed in the given state
- Give at least three examples of standard exceptions
- Explain how a finally block works and when one should be used
- Create negative tests to verify that code throws an exception when necessary
