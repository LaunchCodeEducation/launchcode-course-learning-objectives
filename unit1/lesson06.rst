- Explain how an anonymous function can be called, even though it doesnâ€™t have a defined name
- Explain common uses of anonymous functions

Functions As Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Understand and describe how functions in JavaScript can be used as values
- Assign anonymous and named functions to variables

- Call a function that takes another function as an argument

Recursion
^^^^^^^^^

- Describe the concept of a recursive problem, including the definitions of **base case** and **recursive case**
- Explain how base cases are important in preventing infinite recursion
