Unit 1 - Lesson 6 Learning Objectives
=====================================

Goals
-----

- Create and use anonymous functions
- Use recursion to create algorithms that solve recursive problems
- Use functions as input parameters to other functions

Objectives
----------

Anonymous Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Write an anonymous function
- Explain how an anonymous function can be called, even though it
   doesnâ€™t have a defined name

Functions As Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Understand and describe how functions in JavaScript can be used as
   values
- Assign anonyous functions to variables
- Write a function that takes another function as an input parameter
- Call a function that takes another function as an input parameter

Recursion
^^^^^^^^^

- Describe the concept of a recursive problem, including the
   definitions of **base case** and **recursive case**
- Explain how base cases are important in preventing infinite loops
- Write a recursive function
