# Unit 1 - Lesson 7 Learning Objectives

## Goals

- Use test-driven development to define the behavior of code before writing it, and to ensure that code is properly tested
- Effectively throw and catch exceptions to improve user experience and make debugging easier
- Use problem-solving best practices to use a structured approach to solving large and difficult problems

## Objectives

### Test-driven Development

- Explain how test-driven development helps reduce bugs in code
- Use the red-green-refactor technique to implement TDD

### Exceptions

- Explain what an exception is and why exceptions are used
- Write a program using a try/catch block
- Catch exceptions only when something meaningful can be done
- Throw exceptions with clear, descriptive messages
- Throw exceptions only when the program can not be properly executed in the given state
- Give at least three examples of standard exceptions
- Explain how a finally block works and when one should be used
- Create negative tests to verify that code throws an exception when necessary

### Problem Solving

- Employ common problem solving strategies: restate the problem, clarify what you know, reduce the problem, and look for similarities to other problems you have solved
