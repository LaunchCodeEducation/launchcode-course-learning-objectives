# Unit 1 - Lesson 5 Learning Objectives

## Goals

- Create and use anonymous functions
- Use recursion to create algorithms that solve recursive problems
- Use functions as input parameters to other functions

## Objectives

### Functions As Values

- Understand and describe how functions in JavaScript can be used as values
- Assign anonyous functions to variables
- Write a function that takes another function as an input parameter
- Call a function that takes another function as an input parameter

### Anonymous Functions

- Write an anonymous function
- Explain how an anonymous function can be called, even though it doesn't have a defined name

### Recursion

- Describe the concept of a recursive problem, including the definitions of _base case_ and _recursive case_
- Explain how base cases are important in preventing infinite loops
- Write a recursive function
