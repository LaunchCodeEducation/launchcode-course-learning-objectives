# Unit 1 - Lesson 2 Learning Objectives

## Goals

- Understand how common boolean expressions are evaluated
- Use boolean expression to create conditional statements
- Debug simple programs and recognize common errors

## Objectives

### Booleans

- Explain what a boolean value is
- Explain what logical operators are
- Explain what a boolean expression is
- Use `==` and `===` to compare values
- Explain the difference between `==` and `===`
- Write boolean expressions using comparison operators and equality operators
- Write boolean expressions using logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Understand the truth tables for binary boolean operators `&&` and `||`
- Explain and properly implement expressions that rely on operator precedence
- Use `Boolean` to convert non-boolean values

### Conditionals

- Write an `if` statement with and without an `else` clause
- Write code with nested conditionals
- Write a conditional using `if` statement and an `else if` clause
- Explain the relationship between conditionals and boolean expressions

### Debugging

- Describe how to debug programs using `console.log` and comments
- Explain the three common error types: syntax error, runtime error, semantic error
- Give examples of each of the three common error types
- Explain some best practices to avoid errors and debugging
- Explain how each of the following errors may occur, with examples: `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`
