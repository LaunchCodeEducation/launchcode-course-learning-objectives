Unit 1 - Lesson 7 Learning Objectives
=====================================

Goals
-----

- Create and use collections in C#
- Use the ``Math`` module for common mathematical operations
- Create and work with common collections objects
- Understand how to choose a collection type for a given objects
- Use basic control flow structures 

Objectives
----------

C# Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Describe what a data structure is and why it is useful
- Create ``List``, and ``Dictionary`` objects using ``new``
- Articulate the differences in the above two structures
- Articulate the differences between ``List`` and ``Array``
- Use common ``List`` and ``Dictionary`` methods and properties
- Iterate through the data structures
- Format strings and escape characters
- Use the ``StringBuilder`` class


Control Flow with Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use conditional statements: ``if``, ``if-else``, ``else if``, and ``switch``
- Explain how **fallthrough** occurs with ``switch`` statements and how to prevent it
- Use loops: ``for``, ``foreach``, ``while``, and ``do-while``
- Modify the flow of control in loops using ``break`` and ``continue``
- Explain the difference between ``break`` and ``continue``


The ``Math`` Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use ``Math.PI`` to obtain the value of the mathematical constant Pi
- Understand and properly use common ``Math`` functions: ``Round``, ``Floor``, ``Ceiling``, ``Sqrt``, ``Truncate``, ``Abs``
- Understand and properly use Random Class random number generator
