Goals
-----

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Understand the basic components of classes
- Use classes to create objects
- Create well-designed classes
=======
- Understand how the manner and location of variable declaration affects how it can be used.
- Define variables with the minimal scope necessary.
- Effectively throw and catch exceptions to improve user experience and make debugging easier

Objectives
----------

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Understand the relationship between a class and an object
- Understand the two types of class members: fields and methods
- Successfully declare a class with both fields and methods
- Properly use the ``this`` keyword
- Use the ``new`` keyword to declare a new **instance** of a class object
- Explain how encapsulation results in better code
- Explain and properly use the five access modifiers: ``public``, ``private``, ``protected``, ``protected internal``, and ``internal`` (or default access)
- Explain why fields should almost always be ``private``
- Explain some of the most common reasons for using getters and setters to expose access to private fields
- Describe what a property is in C#, and how it is different from a field
- Explain what code is created by the compiler when you create an auto-implemented property
- Create and use constructors to properly initialize class instances
- Describe and use constructor overloading
- Describe the default constructor, including when and how it will be provided for a given class
- Use ``this()`` to invoke one constructor from within another in the same class
- Define and call instance methods of an object
- Reference instance properties within methods
- Use the Single Responsibility Principle to create small, well-designed classes
=======
Scope
^^^^^

- Understand the contexts in which a variable may be declared: class level, method level, block level (nested scope)
- Understand and properly declare variables in the best context for the intended use
- Describe shadowing, and how it affects variable visibility


Exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^

- Explain what an exception is and why exceptions are used
- Write a program using a try/catch block
- Catch exceptions only when something meaningful can be done
- Throw exceptions with clear, descriptive messages
- Throw exceptions only when the program can not be properly executed in the given state
- Give at least three examples of standard exceptions
- Explain how a finally block works and when one should be used
- Create negative tests to verify that code throws an exception when necessary
