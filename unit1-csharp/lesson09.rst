==========================================

Goals
-----

- Understand the basic components of classes
- Use classes to create objects
- Create well-designed classes

Objectives
----------

- Understand the relationship between a class and an object
- Understand the two types of class members: fields and methods
- Successfully declare a class with both fields and methods
- Properly use the ``this`` keyword
- Use the ``new`` keyword to declare a new **instance** of a class object
- Explain how encapsulation results in better code
- Explain and properly use the five access modifiers: ``public``, ``private``, ``protected``, ``protected internal``, and ``internal`` (or default access)
- Explain why fields should almost always be ``private``
- Explain some of the most common reasons for using getters and setters to expose access to private fields
- Describe what a property is in C#, and how it is different from a field
- Explain what code is created by the compiler when you create an auto-implemented property
- Create and use constructors to properly initialize class instances
- Describe and use constructor overloading
- Describe the default constructor, including when and how it will be provided for a given class
- Use ``this()`` to invoke one constructor from within another in the same class
- Define and call instance methods of an object
- Reference instance properties within methods
- Use the Single Responsibility Principle to create small, well-designed classes
