=====================================================================

Goals
-----

- Use binary search to efficiently find elements in ordered collections as well as binary search trees
- Understand Binary Search Tree operations and their big-O efficiency

Objectives
----------

- Understand and write code to conduct a binary search on an ordered collection (e.g. an array or list)
- Explain why a data set must be sorted before conducting a binary search
- Understand the conceptual structure of a binary tree
- Understand the conceptual structure of a binary search tree
- Explain how to carry out binary search on a binary search tree
- Understand common operations on BSTs and their big-O efficiency
   - insert
   - remove
   - traverse
- Understand the concept of depth of a BST
- Explain what it means for a BST to be balanced
- Explain how a BST might become unbalanced (including worst-case scenarios), and how an unbalanced tree affects the efficiency of a binary search
- Understand how to balance a BST
