Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis - Lesson 1 Learning Objectives
=====================================================================

Goals
-----

- Understand how to express asymptotic worst-case runtime for an algorithm using Big-O notation
- Sort ordered collections with Insertion Sort

Objectives
----------

- Explain the formal definition of big-O. In other words, what does it mean to say that *f(x)* is *O(g(x))*? 
- Explain the practical application of big-O to analyze the worst-case behavior of a function, in terms of the number of inputs *n*
- Provide examples of functions with common time complexity: constant, polynomial (including linear and quadratic), logarithmic 
- Use the following big-O operations to simplify big-O expressions: sum, product, multiply by a constant
- Use the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an ordered collection (such as a list or array), using both recursive and non-recursive techniques
- Calculate the big-O value for Insertion Sort
