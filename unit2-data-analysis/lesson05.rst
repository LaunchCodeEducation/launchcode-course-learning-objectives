Lesson 5: Lists
===============

Goals
-----

- Understand that lists are ordered collections similar to arrays
- Understand the syntax for creating new lists
- Work with lists using bracket notation, iteration, and common list methods

Objectives
----------

- Assign a list literal to a variable
- Create lists that store multiple values of the same or different data types
- Use bracket notation and index values to access or modify one element in a
  list
- Use bracket notation to access or modify a slice of multiple elements in
  a list
- Use iteration to loop through the elements within a list
- Recognize that lists are mutable
- Use common list methods and properties: ``len()``, ``append()``, ``clear()``, ``count()``, ``index()``,
  ``insert()``, ``pop()``, ``remove()``, ``reverse()``, ``sort()``.
- Use the ``copy()`` method to make an independent clone of a list.
- Use the ``max()`` and ``min()`` functions to return the largest and smallest
  values in a list.
- Create lists that store other lists (i.e. multi-dimensional lists).
- Access elements within multi-dimensional lists.
- Use ``join()`` to convert a list of string elements into a single string.
- Use the ``in`` operator to check if a value is present in a list.
