Lesson 6: Dictionaries and tuples
=================================

Goals
-----

- Create and use Python dictionaries
- Create and use Python tuples
- Recognize the benefits and drawbacks of dictionaries vs. lists vs. tuples

Objectives
----------

- Understand that dictionaries are collections of properties stored as
  **key/value pairs**
- Recognize that dictionaries are *unordered* collections of data values.
- Create and assign dictionary values using ``{ }``
- Describe the allowed data types for **keys** and **values**
- Access and/or change the value of a key by using bracket notation
- Use bracket notation to add new key/value pairs to a dictionary
- Use the ``.keys()``, ``.values()``, and ``.items()`` methods to retrieve a
  list of the keys, values, or key/value pairs from a dictionary
- Use a loop to iterate through the keys, values, or key/value pairs of a
  dictionary
- Utilize dictionaries as parameters, arguments, and return values of
  functions
- Understand that tuples are ordered collections of properties
- Understand that tuples are immutable
- Create and assign tuple values using ``()`` syntax
