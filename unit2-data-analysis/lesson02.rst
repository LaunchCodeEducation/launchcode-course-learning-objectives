Control flow and modules
========================

Goals
-----

- Use basic control flow structures
- Import Python modules into new programs
- Create modules to export to other programs

Objectives
----------

Control Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use conditional statements: ``if``, ``else``, and ``elif``
- Use loops: ``for`` and ``while``
- Modify the flow of control in loops using ``break`` and ``continue``
- Explain the difference between ``break`` and ``continue``

Modules
^^^^^^^

- Be able to import predefined Python modules into a program
- Be able to call functions imported from a module
- Explain the difference between ``import module_name`` and
  ``from module_name import function_name``
- Use common functions from the ``random`` module: ``choice``, ``randint``,
  ``random``
- Use common functions and constants from the ``math`` module: ``ceil``,
  ``floor``, ``pi``, ``sqrt``
- Use the ``round()`` function with different ``random`` and ``math``
  functions
- Create modules and successfully import them into other programs.
- Understand why adding a ``main()`` function is important when building a
  module
