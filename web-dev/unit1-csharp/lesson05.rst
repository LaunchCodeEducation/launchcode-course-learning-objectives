Unit 1 - Lesson 5 Learning Objectives
=====================================

Goals
-----

Lists
^^^^^

- Create and use lists in C#
- Create and work with common ``List`` methods

Methods
^^^^^^^
- Understand the role of methods in making code modular and reusable
- Create programmer-defined methods

Objectives
----------

Lists
^^^^^

- Describe what a data structure is and why it is useful
- Create ``List`` objects using ``new``
- Articulate the differences between ``List`` and ``Array``
- Use common ``List`` methods and properties
- Use basic control flow structures to iterate through a ``List`` object


Methods
^^^^^^^

*Note:* All objectives below refer to named methods

- Explain what a method is
- Write a method with no parameters, a single parameter, and multiple parameters
- Call a method, with and without parameters
- Understand the behavior of parameters that are not provided by the caller
- Use a ``return`` statement to complete execution of a method
- Use a ``return`` statement to provide a value to the method caller
- Explain what a ``return`` statement does
- Understand variable scope as it pertains to methods
- Explain what variable shadowing is
- Write a method that calls another method
- Use properly descriptive names when defining method



Objectives
----------

C# Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Describe what a data structure is and why it is useful
- Create ``List``, and ``Dictionary`` objects using ``new``
- Articulate the differences in the above two structures
- Articulate the differences between ``List`` and ``Array``
- Use common ``List`` and ``Dictionary`` methods and properties
- Iterate through the data structures
- Format strings and escape characters
- Use the ``StringBuilder`` class


Control Flow with Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use conditional statements: ``if``, ``if-else``, ``else if``, and ``switch``
- Explain how **fallthrough** occurs with ``switch`` statements and how to prevent it
- Use loops: ``for``, ``foreach``, ``while``, and ``do-while``
- Modify the flow of control in loops using ``break`` and ``continue``
- Explain the difference between ``break`` and ``continue``
