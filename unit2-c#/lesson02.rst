Unit 2 (C#) - Lesson 2 Learning Objectives
============================================

Goals
-----

- Use basic control flow structures
- Create and work with common collections objects
- Understand how to choose a collection type for a given problem

Objectives
----------

Control Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use conditional statements: ``if``, ``else``, ``else if``, ``switch``
- Explain how **fallthrough** occurs ``switch`` statements and how to prevent it
- Use loops: ``for``, ``for-each``, ``while``, and ``do-while``
- Modify the flow of control in loops using ``break`` and ``continue``
- Explain the difference between ``break`` and ``continue``

C# Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Create array, ``ArrayList``, and ``HashMap`` objects using ``new``
- Use bracket notation to access array elements
- Use common ``ArrayList`` and ``HashMap`` methods
- Explain the differences between an array and an ``ArrayList``
- Iterate through ``ArrayList`` and ``HashMap``
- Know about the C# Collections Framework, and why one might choose a given collection type over another
